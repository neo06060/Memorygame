# Overview
As a software engineer exploring interactive 3D environments and web-based rendering, I created this project to deepen my understanding of Three.js, 3D transformations, and event-driven interactions within the browser.

This software features a spinning 3D geometric object (a wireframe cube) that users can click to toggle between two different thematic background boards. The object rotates in real-time, and interaction triggers visual transitions to mimic elements from the game Inscryption, making it visually immersive.

The goal was to build a visually dynamic user interface using WebGL and also demonstrate concepts such as animation loops, background texture loading, and user interactivity â€” all wrapped in clean JavaScript logic.
